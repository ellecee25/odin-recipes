    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A warm and comforting meal perfect for rainy days.</p>
    <p>Worth the wait!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds yellow onions, peeled and thinly sliced (approx 5-6 large onions)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>6 cups of beef stock (or veggie stock)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>fine sea salt and freshly-cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>baguette</li>
        <li>grated or sliced cheese (such as Gruyere, Asiago, Swiss, Gouda, or Mozarella)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large heavy-bottomed stockpot, melt the butter over medium-high heat.<br>
        Add the onions and saute until well done, about 30 minutes, initially stirring every<br>
        3-5 minutes, then about once aminute near the end of carmelization to prevent burning.<br>
        Add garlic and saute for 2 minutes. Stir in the flour and cook for an additional 1 minute<br>
        Stir in the wine to deglaze the pan, using a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits on the<br>
        bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the stock, Worcestershire, bay leaf, and thyme and stir to combine. Continue to cook<br>
        until the soup reaches a simmer. The reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer for<br>
        at least 10 minutes. Discard the bay leaf and sprigs of thyme. Taste the soup and<br>
        season with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400F. While the soup is simmering, slice the baguette into<br>
        1-inch thick pieces and arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake for<br>
        6-8 minutes, until the bread is toasted and golden around the edges. Remove and set aside.</li>
        <li>Switch the oven to the broiler. Once the soup is ready to serve, place your<br>
        oven-safe bowls on a thick baking sheet. Ladle the soup into each bowl, then top with a<br>
        baguette slice and about 1/4 cup shredded cheese. Place on an oven rack about 6 inches from<br>
        the heat and broil for 2-4 minutes, or until cheese is melted and bubbly. Remove <br>
        from the oven and serve immediately while the soup is hot and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
